## 🧪 Local development

The forum and account pages now use a lightweight Node.js server (no external dependencies) to write posts, uploads, and account records into this repository. To work on the site locally:

1. Start the server with `npm start` (or `node server.js`) and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2. Forum posts are saved into `data/posts.json`, accounts into `data/accounts.json`, and any uploaded media into `uploads/forum/` so they can be committed.
