## 🧪 Local development & storage

The site runs entirely on static hosting. Forum accounts and posts are saved with the visitor's browser storage, so nothing is synced or committed back to the repository.

1. Open `/account/` to create a username, email, and password. Passwords are hashed before they are stored locally.
2. Sign in on the same page—once signed in, your status is remembered in this browser so you can post on `/forums/`.
3. Share text, images (up to 2&nbsp;MB), short video clips (up to 6&nbsp;MB), or links on the forum. Attachments are stored as data URLs inside the same local storage bucket.

If the browser blocks local storage (e.g., strict privacy or incognito modes), accounts and posts will only last for the current session.
